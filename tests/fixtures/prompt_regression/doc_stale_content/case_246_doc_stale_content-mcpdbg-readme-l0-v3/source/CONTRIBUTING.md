## 📜 Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All contributors are expected to follow it. Please be respectful and professional in all interactions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm (required — `workspace:*` protocol needs pnpm, not npm)
- Python 3.7+ (for debugging Python code)
- Go 1.18+ and Delve (for debugging Go code, optional)
- Rust toolchain (for debugging Rust code, optional — CodeLLDB auto-downloads during install)
- JDK 21+ (for debugging Java code, optional — JDI bridge compiles on first use; compile target code with `javac -g` for variable inspection)
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-debugger.git
   cd mcp-debugger
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/debugmcp/mcp-debugger.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 💻 Development Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following our code style guidelines

4. **Build and test**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits (see below)

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to our `main` branch

## 🔒 Privacy Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit personal information to the repository. This includes:

- Personal file paths (e.g., `C:\path\to\` or `/path/to/`)
- Personal email addresses (project emails like `debug@sycamore.llc` are okay)
- Cloud storage paths with personal folders
- Any other personally identifiable information

### Pre-commit Hook

We have a pre-commit hook that automatically checks for personal information patterns. If detected, your commit will be blocked with instructions on how to fix it.

### How to Handle Paths

When documenting or writing examples, always use generic paths like:
- `/path/to/project`
- `C:\path\to\project`
- `~/workspace/project`

### Testing the Privacy Check

You can manually run the privacy check:
```bash
# Check staged files (what pre-commit does)
npm run check:personal-paths

# Check all files in the repository
npm run check:all-personal-paths
```

## 🎨 Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style.

### Setup

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier (if configured)
npm run format
```

### Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use dependency injection patterns (see existing code)

### Editor Configuration

We recommend configuring your editor to:
- Format on save using Prettier
- Show ESLint warnings/errors inline
- Use the project's TypeScript version

Example VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
```

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite. Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request. If you're adding a new feature, please include tests for it.

### Running Tests

The project uses **Vitest** as its test runner:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e         # End-to-end tests only

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/unit/session/session-manager.test.ts
```

### Test Architecture

Our tests follow a three-tiered approach:

1.  **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation.
    *   Focus: Session management, debugger provider implementations, utility functions.
2.  **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components.
    *   Focus: Complete debugging workflow tests, DAP message sequencing.
3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Test the full system with actual `debugpy` servers.
    *   Focus: Full debugging scenarios from MCP request to `debugpy` interaction and back.

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## 📝 Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples

```bash
feat(debugger): add support for conditional breakpoints

Added ability to set breakpoints with conditions that are evaluated
at runtime. This allows for more precise debugging workflows.

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(session): handle disconnect during stepping

Fixed race condition where disconnect during step operations
could leave the session in an invalid state.
```
